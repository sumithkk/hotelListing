      "text": "Friends recommended this hotel to me (family, mum, dad and 9 year old) and I was a touch apprehensive as a three day stay was only a touch over GBP20 per day.\nHowever, our room was made available at 13.00 and I was most pleased with the standard of the room and bathroom.  The bed was comfortable, the room size sufficient, with a small balcony,  and the bathroom fitted to a fairly high standard.\nThe breakfast, at first look, wasn't too impressive because, as a Brit (albeit I haven't lived there for forty years) I still yearn for a greasy Joe's, but when I realized I was the only non-Russian in the hotel, I jelled in to the cold meats, cheese, pate and salads (with olives and gerkins to kill for) and thoroughly enjoyed my four assorted breakfast plates.\nThe swimming pool, though small, is on the top floor and immaculately clean.\nThe hotel is 100m from the beach.\nThe cellar provides safe storage if you're on a motorbike (as we were).\nThe reception are helpful.\nThe room service seemed fast and efficient.\nIn all, no cons here.\nWould I come back?\nIf i wanted an inexpensive hotel, a definite yes.",

      "text": "The hotel was clean and situated centrally. Food was steps away and the beach was steps away. \nThe one issue with the hotel was the Breakfast food. I don't expect much from any buffet, no matter where I go, but this was horrible. Nothing seemed fresh. Pancakes/waffles must of been out too long - they were rubbery. The bacon looked like it died a few times before cooked - or on another day, it wasn't cooked enough. The food they had was very catered to Russian delicacies as the main tourists in Nha Trang are Russians - if you are looking for a Western Breakfast, this is not where you will find it. \nThe cleaners also seemed to clean our room late. We were on the 9th floor. Sometimes we would come back to the room at 2pm and it would still not be clean. Not sure if that was due to shortage of staff or just how the hotel does things, regardless, it was a but of a nuisance.",

There are a lot of restaurants around. \n\nThings to be aware of:\n1. From the pictures of the hotel the rooftop pool looked really nice but it turned out to be rather small. \n2. Wifi was kinda unstable.\n3. The walkie-talkie of the cleaning staff was quite loud - we could hear them talking to one another in our room.\n4. Our room was not as clean as we expected - the ventilation vent in the bathroom was dusty and the floor under the bed was also a bit dusty.",

We are lucky to be in the heart of the city hence it is very convenient for guests to go for shopping, restaurants, bars… We are only 2 minutes by walk away from the beach.\n\nRegarding the Wi-Fi, during your stay, all three submarine optical cable lines connecting to Vietnam had problems affecting Vietnam's internet speed. The internet operator confirmed that it would take about one month to fix it. We ask for your understanding as it is beyond our control.\n\nRegarding the cleaning and the walkie-talkie of the cleaning staff, we are sorry for the inconvenience.Your remarks will be passed on to the housekeeping department.\nWe strongly ask each and every respective department to implement and improve our services day by day. It is our main purpose as a top 4-star hotel in Nha Trang. \nIt would be our pleasure to welcome you back to the Legendsea Hotel Nha Trang for your next visit to Viet Nam.\n\nThanks again and we hope to see you in another occasion.\n\nBest regards,\nHoang D.\n",

More than happy to book us ticketa to Vinpearl land.\nHotel location was good - close to shops, restaurants, bars ,beach and a million different massage places, so everything we needed was within waking distance.\nBreakfast buffet was pretty good .\n\nDownside\nBathroom had worst design ever!\n Was impossible to take a shower without flooding the entire bathroom. Even with an overkill of shower curtains. \n\nHousekeeping came very late in the day so after a day out exploring and returning to hotel around 4:30pm for a rest got Interrupted each day while trying to rest up. \nTried asking for housekeeping earlier , as we left hotel at 8am but to no avail.  Not a huge deal but no one likes been woken from a nap 😖\n",

      "text": "The room was lovely - spacious, clean, good lighting, good clothes space, nice parquet floor, great bed, bathroom - except for one thing. The TV was poor - poor reception, predominantly Vietnamese channels and no English news channel apart from France 24. This hardly mattered because we did not go on holiday to watch TV, but it would have been nice to catch the news headlines on BBC or CNN or to have had a range of movie channels.\nThe buffet breakfast was adequate but not spectacular. I enjoyed the freshly cooked omelette and toasted brown bread along with fruit, but the range of available foods was limited. Also there was a disparity between the printed hotel deal of no free buffet breakfast and the reality - free buffet breakfast.\nThe reception staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel is situated in the centre of town not far from the beach.\nAll in all, I would come here again.",

Did everything they could to help us check in early as soon as the rooms were ready. Stones throw from the beach, central location, awesome rooftop pool. Decent breakfast spread, the only negative is I wanted fruit than was available at breakfast, but that’s me being picky.",

      "text": "On planning a visit to Nha Trang after 50 years I chose this hotel for its familiar and convenient location and the booking deal I found on line. \nI am glad that I did. \nLocation is excellent with a two minute walk to the beach, short walks to bars and restaurants. My room was perfect for a solo traveler, clean and comfortable with basic amenities such as a hair dryer and a mini-refrigerator. Housekeeping was attentive to room condition each day. Staff is/was always friendly and helpful, dining room staff the same at breakfast. One minor issue, as someone who needs to do a number of stretching exercises for my back, yoga mats in the fitness center might be a good idea. If they are there I overlooked them.\nIf I ever have the opportunity to return to Nha Trang I would definitely book this hotel again. ",

Has a nice swimming pool area with bar, small but nice sunbathe area. Good views of the city and a small view of the beach, between 2 other hotels.  WIFI is free and was very good (we went low season so hotel and wifi bandwidth may not have been busy, we got around 20Mb/s download, all day with no issues). \n\nOverall a nice environment with friendly staff.  It isn't a \"wow\" hotel, but definitely a practical offering.  Beach is only a 2 min walk (albeit across 2 busy roads, where you have to do the usual dodging traffic - this is normal in Vietnam).  Plenty of local shops nearby and some nice restaurants.  ",

The room was clean and spacious and had a huge window front. Since it was located on the top floor ( 18th floor) we didn't get much of the noise of the busy street it's located on. The breakfast buffet offered a quite big range of international options from Asian to western.",

We love the room in the corner with the paronama sea view and bigger than the other room. the hotel is well located near the beach and bustle road with a lot of  amenities, restaurant as well as the walking street. The breakfast is nice with popular choice of Western or Vietnamese cuisine. One thing we are disappointed was althought the breakfast start at 6 am, the fact is that they just start to set up the buffet in the restaurant and we have to wait until 6.30 am. By the way, everything is alright.",

Our room was great with a balcony view straight down the street to the beach and the air con cooled the room very well which made sleeping easy. The selection at breakfast was good but the pancakes would be better cooked to order, with a great view out onto the street so you could people and traffic watch while eating breakfast. The pool located on the roof of the building was a nice place to relax although a bit warm but did have great views. The hotel does need a little work on its appearance and some aspects of customer service which I have advised the hotel management of.  Would I stay at the Legend Seas Hotel again? YES.",
